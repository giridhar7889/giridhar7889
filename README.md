## 

I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Computer science 2019-2023.
I use the DJANGO framework for backend development to create an extremely secure and brief website. When it comes to software development I am thoroughly skillful in writing effienent algorithms and programming in a way that is fit and sensible.I have a good understanding of blockchain technology and i might go after it. Apart from programming, I spend my time learning the vastness of space and time to unlock the secrets of the universe. It may sound crazy but if we find the answer to those questions, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason. I am eager to provide reliable and consistent results that are indestructible and solid.

See ya , Have fun.
