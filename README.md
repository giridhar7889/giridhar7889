## 

I love tackling  problems ,the ones without obvious solutions, that require both creativity and rigor. It’s the same curiosity that drives me to experiment with RAG pipelines, optimize latency, and think about evaluation loops not just as metrics, but as product insights.

Before this, I co-founded Novat.ai, an AI platform that automated bank transaction classification from PDFs and Excel statements with over 95% accuracy. I built the product from scratch , architecting low-latency systems, automating manual workflows, and iterating daily with real accountants and bookkeepers. Working directly with users taught me that being customer-obsessed isn’t about perfect code , it’s about outcomes. Every feature, every optimization, came down to a single question: does this make someone’s life easier, faster, or more human?

I’ve always been drawn to problems most people overlook , the ones that seem too complex or ingrained to fix. That’s what excites me about Startups.Startups are solving high-stakes, high-complexity problems that demand both precision and creativity , the exact mix that drives me.

I want to be in an environment that feels : fast-paced, high-energy, and full of ownership. I like being in situations where the outcome depends directly on my decisions and actions , where I can succeed or fail visibly, and grow from it. That’s where I’ve learned the most, and it’s the kind of environment where I can bring my best drive and curiosity.

I obsess over problems no one else notices.
I challenge decisions that others accept.
I can go from idea to finished feature without managers telling me what to do.
I am Customer obsessed, i love talking to customers and understanding their pain points because i love it.
