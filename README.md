## 

I co-founded Novat, an AI platform that automates bank transaction classification from PDF and Excel statements with over 95% accuracy in minutes a process that previously took hours of tedious manual work. I personally led the design of our proprietary AI pipeline, which learns from every user correction in real time, making the product smarter and faster with each use. We went from idea to a fully deployed, revenue-generating product in record time, securing adoption from professional accountants and competing head-to-head with larger incumbents proving my ability to identify high-impact problems, engineer groundbreaking solutions, and execute at a world-class level.What matters most to me is the work itself the mission, the challenges, and the impact. I’m driven by the opportunity to build something meaningful and solve real problems. That kind of purpose gives me a sense of fulfillment that even the best team dynamics alone can’t provide. Of course, working alongside passionate, talented people makes the journey even better, but for me, it starts with the 'why' behind the work.
